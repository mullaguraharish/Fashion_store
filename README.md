# Fashion-store

Hello all, I am Kanduri Jayanth Sri Ram from Indian Institute of Information Technology, Sri City. This is my project submission for 
Future ready talent Internship.

#### Industry: 
Lifestyle

#### Project Title: 
Fashion store

#### Problem Statement/Opportunity: 
E-commerce helps lower the cost of a product and allows less wealthy people to buy it. It has given us access to services and products that are not  available in rural areas. It also provides an important platform for promoting and marketing products around the world. website is an interesting idea for introducing new products to customers. Websites provide business people with the opportunity to communicate with their customers over the Internet. Luxury brands weren't ready to stop production in preparation for the Covid 19 outbreak. No one was ready, but the good thing about e-commerce, lifestyle and fashion brands is that they are almost always the creative acclaim of the moment. Consumers most often enjoy the convenience and simplicity of shopping online and delivering orders. Industry adoption and growth is magical as fashion and lifestyle brands listen to consumers changing their norms regarding style.

#### Project Description: 
E-commerce as an economic development opportunity. E-commerce allows people to buy and sell physical goods, services, and digital products over the internet rather than at a brick-and-mortar location. Through an e-commerce website, a business can process orders, accept payments, manage shipping and logistics, and provide customer service. Small businesses have the opportunity to penetrate the market with their products.  New jobs are also created in supporting sectors, such as technology companies, payment service providers, and logistics companies.
#### Problem: 
Rural people and Villagers was not able to afford all services and products as they cost higher. 
#### Solution: 
E-commerce has enabled rural areas to access services and products, which are otherwise not available to them. What problem are you trying to solve and how are you solving it? Even villagers and rural people, as well as hardworking urban people, are always busy with their work and cannot go to shops and buy whatever they need, so e-commerce website services help them buy things in their homes and help people get things at a low price. Also, consider grandpa and granny who may not be able to go to hospitals or grocery stores every now and then, but they can access an app or website and get whatever they want in e-commerce websites. As a result, the e-commerce sector offers more solutions to people's problems, making an e-commerce app and website is the ideal option.
